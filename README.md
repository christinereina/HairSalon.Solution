# _Hairon Â© Salon_

#### By _**Christine Augustine**_


## Description

This application is a MVC web application to help Hairon manage their stylists and their clients. Hairon should be able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist.

*This web application was highly inspired by Beyonce's, "Black is King" and uses different images from her artwork. Also, this application was stylistically inspired by Saint Heron.*
