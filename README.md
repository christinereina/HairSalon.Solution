## Description

This application is a MVC web application to help Hairon manage their stylists and their clients. Hairon should be able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist.

## Specifications

User is greeted with a splash Welcome page. 

| Behavior   |   Input   |  Output |

| User clicks on available Stylist Name | Click: 'Luna' | Stylist Details will appear: Name, Services Offered, Clients. User will have the option to: Edit Stylist, Delete Stylist
