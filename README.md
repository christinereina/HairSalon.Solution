#### By _**Christine Augustine**_

## Description

This application is a MVC web application to help Hairon manage their stylists and their clients. Hairon should be able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist.

## Setup/Installation Requirements 

1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/christinereina/HairSalon.Solution) from GitHub
2. Open the downloaded directory in a text editor of your choice. (VSCode, Atom, etc.)
3. Once you have the directory open, navigate to the top level of the directory and create a `appsettings.json` file which contains:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=christine_augustine;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```
4. Then, install the REPL dotnet script, run dotnet tool `install -g dotnet-script` in your terminal.
5. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:
```
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### Installing and Configuring MySQL

1. Start by downloading the MySQL Community Server .dmg file [HERE](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914). Click the download icon. Use the *No thanks, just start my download link*.
2. Follow along with the Install, once on the configuation make sure you:
- Use Legacy Password Encryption.
- Set a unique password
3. Once finished, open your terminal and enter the command echo `export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile`. This will save this path in .bash_profile, which is where our terminal is configured.
4. Next, download the MySQL Workbench .dmg file [HERE](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391). Again, use the *No thanks, just start my download link*.
5.Install MySQL Workbench to Applications folder.

### Recreating the Local Database

1. Open **MySQL Workbench**, select Local 3306 and enter your password
2. Use this query selection to create the database:
```
CREATE DATABASE `christine_augustine`; 

USE `christine_augustine`;

CREATE TABLE `clients` (
  `ClientId` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `StylistId` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `Name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Service` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Appointment` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ClientId`)
);

CREATE TABLE `stylists` (
  `StylistId` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Name` varchar(225) DEFAULT NULL,
  `ServicesOffered` varchar(225) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`StylistId`)
);
```
3. Once it connects, you should be all set!
